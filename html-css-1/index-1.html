                HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. 
                It is the fifth and last[3] major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. 
                The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by a consortium of the 
                major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext Application Technology 
                Working Group (WHATWG).<br><br>
                HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[4] with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" 
                status in October 2014.[2][5] Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and 
                other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers 
                and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with 
                older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.[6]

            <h3>About CSS3</h3>

            <p>
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a 
                document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the 
                World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]<br></br>

                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, 
                and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control 
                in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by 
                specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the 
                structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between 
                the pages that share the file and its formatting. Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different 
                styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser 
                or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if 
                the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]<br><br>

                The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more 
                than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable. The CSS specifications
                 are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered 
                 for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]
